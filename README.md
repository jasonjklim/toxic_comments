<p>This is a competition from Kaggle, Toxic Comment Classification.</p>

<h3>The dataset is from Wikipedia’s talk page edits’ comments. I challenge to build a multi-label classification that capable to detect different types of toxicity such as threats, obscenity, insults, and identity-based hate.</h3>
